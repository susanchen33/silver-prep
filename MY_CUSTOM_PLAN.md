## 🧠 The "Before You Code" Ritual

**Do this for EVERY problem:**

```
□ 1. Read problem completely (2-3 min)
□ 2. Check constraint N → What complexity is allowed?
□ 3. Identify data structure (array, grid, graph, tree?)
□ 4. Look for trigger phrases:
     □ "Minimize maximum" → Binary Search?
     □ "Maximize minimum" → Binary Search?
     □ "Connected/reachable" → DFS/BFS?
     □ "Count subarrays" → Prefix Sums/Two Pointers?
     □ "Non-overlapping intervals" → Greedy?
□ 5. Write algorithm choice BEFORE coding
□ 6. Verify with small example
□ 7. THEN start coding
```

## 💡 Key Principle

> **Don't just solve problems. CLASSIFY first, then solve.**

The goal isn't to solve 100 problems. It's to build the pattern recognition that lets you instantly know: "This is a binary search problem" or "This needs DFS."

**Quality > Quantity.** 

One problem with full analysis beats five problems solved by looking at hints.
