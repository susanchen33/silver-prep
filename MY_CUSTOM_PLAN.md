# 🎯 Your Personalized Study Plan

Based on your self-assessment:
- **Weakest topic:** Graphs
- **Key gap:** Pattern recognition (especially knowing WHEN to use binary search)

This plan prioritizes building **intuition** over just learning algorithms.

|-----|----------|
| 1-2 | **Mock Contest 1** (Dec 2020 Silver) + full review |
| 3-4 | **Mock Contest 2** (Jan 2021 Silver) + full review |
| 5 | Review all pattern notes, re-do hardest problems |
| 6 | Light review, rest |
| 7 | **Real contest or Mock Contest 3** |

## 🧠 The "Before You Code" Ritual

**Do this for EVERY problem:**

```
□ 1. Read problem completely (2-3 min)
□ 2. Check constraint N → What complexity is allowed?
□ 3. Identify data structure (array, grid, graph, tree?)
□ 4. Look for trigger phrases:
     □ "Minimize maximum" → Binary Search?
     □ "Maximize minimum" → Binary Search?
     □ "Connected/reachable" → DFS/BFS?
     □ "Count subarrays" → Prefix Sums/Two Pointers?
     □ "Non-overlapping intervals" → Greedy?
□ 5. Write algorithm choice BEFORE coding
□ 6. Verify with small example
□ 7. THEN start coding
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

By end of Week 6, you should be able to:

| Skill | Target |
|-------|--------|
| Classify algorithm from problem statement | 80%+ accuracy |
| Recognize binary search problems | 90%+ (it's very pattern-based) |
| Solve graph problems (DFS/BFS) | Confident on USACO Silver level |
| Complete 3 Silver problems in 4 hours | At least 2 fully solved |

## 💡 Key Principle

> **Don't just solve problems. CLASSIFY first, then solve.**

The goal isn't to solve 100 problems. It's to build the pattern recognition that lets you instantly know: "This is a binary search problem" or "This needs DFS."

**Quality > Quantity.** 

One problem with full analysis beats five problems solved by looking at hints.
