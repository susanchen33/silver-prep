# 🏆 Mock Contests

## Overview

Mock contests are essential for USACO preparation. They help you:
- Practice time management (4 hours)
- Build mental stamina
- Identify weak areas
- Get comfortable with contest pressure

## How to Run a Mock Contest

### Before the Contest
1. **Set aside 4 uninterrupted hours**
2. **Prepare your environment:**
   - Close unnecessary tabs/apps
   - Have your template ready
   - Prepare snacks/water
3. **Choose a past contest** you haven't seen

### During the Contest
1. **First 10-15 minutes:** Read ALL problems
2. **Identify easiest problem:** Start there
3. **Don't get stuck:** If stuck >30 min, try another problem
4. **Submit partial solutions:** Even brute force can get 30-50%
5. **Test edge cases:** Empty input, N=1, max values

### After the Contest
1. **Upsolve:** Solve problems you couldn't finish
2. **Read editorials:** Understand optimal approaches
3. **Identify patterns:** What topics were tested?
4. **Update progress tracker**

## Analysis Questions

After each contest, ask yourself:

### Time Management
- [ ] Did I read all problems first?
- [ ] Did I allocate time appropriately?
- [ ] Did I get stuck too long on one problem?

### Problem Solving
- [ ] Did I identify the correct algorithm?
- [ ] Were my implementations bug-free?
- [ ] Did I handle edge cases?

### Mental Game
- [ ] Did I stay calm under pressure?
- [ ] Did I use my time effectively?
- [ ] Did panic affect my performance?

---

## Contest Day Checklist

### Night Before
- [ ] Get good sleep (8+ hours)
- [ ] Prepare contest environment
- [ ] Review templates and common patterns

### Morning Of
- [ ] Eat a good breakfast
- [ ] Light review (don't cram)
- [ ] Arrive early to contest site

### During Contest
- [ ] Read all problems (10-15 min)
- [ ] Start with easiest problem
- [ ] Submit partial solutions
- [ ] Save 30+ minutes for testing
- [ ] Don't panic!

## Common Mistakes in Contests

1. **Not reading carefully**
   - Miss constraints (1-indexed vs 0-indexed)
   - Miss output format requirements

2. **Integer overflow**
   - Always check if `long long` is needed
   - Product of two ints → use `1LL * a * b`

3. **Array bounds**
   - Off-by-one errors
   - Not allocating enough space

4. **Forgetting file I/O**
   - USACO requires file input/output!
   - `freopen("problem.in", "r", stdin);`

5. **Not testing**
   - Always test sample cases
   - Create edge case tests

## Promotion Statistics

To promote from Silver to Gold, you typically need **750-850 points** (varies by contest).

### Scoring Breakdown
- **1 full problem:** 333 points
- **2 full problems:** 666 points  
- **3 full problems:** 1000 points

### Partial Credit Strategy
- Even a brute force O(N²) solution can get 30-50%
- Submit something for every problem
- Optimize later if time permits
